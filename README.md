# Behind-India-s-Food-Inflation
Ever noticed how food prices in India swing wildly — one month onions or tomatoes are cheap, the next they feel unaffordable.
And with that, households adjust their baskets, retailers push offers, and brands change pack sizes.

But what’s really driving these ups and downs? That is what this report aims to explore 

We dive into three years of food inflation data (2021–2024), breaking it down across categories like vegetables, spices, dairy, and staples. We measure volatility and persistence, track seasonal cycles, and map how different food groups move together. Alongside this, we look at the role of weather shocks, policy interventions, and global price pressures in shaping India’s inflation story.

Finally, we connect the dots to consumer behavior and business strategy — how families cope, how retailers adapt, and how FMCG brands rethink pricing, packs, and promotions. This project is both a data-driven analysis and a way to understand the everyday reality behind India’s food inflation.
